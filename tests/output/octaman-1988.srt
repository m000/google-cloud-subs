1
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:03,800
Since the beginning of time men

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:05,900
have roamed the Earth and are

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:07,500
the elements in search of

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,900
Adventure. But today there

5
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,600
is a new breed of Adventurer

6
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:14,300
the scientist who explores

7
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:16,800
Uncharted areas of the world not

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,700
for riches over Adventure,

9
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,300
but in search of answers to man's

10
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,700
problems of pollution and disease

11
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,900
such a man on such a quest

12
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,900
leads an ecological expedition to a primitive.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,700
Of Latin American Fishing Community where

14
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,500
they uncover the Hideous

15
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,600
fruit of atomic radiation

16
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,600
in the form of a bizarre

17
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,600
Legend wrapped in

18
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,600
Terror and Written in

19
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,300
Blood.

20
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,200
Yeah, go see.

21
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,300
Did you get your hat?

22
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,700
Sampling of blood taken from these primitive people whose

23
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,200
main diet is seafood

24
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,800
fish provides

25
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,700
evidence that chemical changes

26
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,900
produced by underwater detonations of

27
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,900
atomic materials have

28
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,800
been carried by tides and currents to

29
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,200
all parts of the world

30
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,800
here is what we learned from this morning's blood sample factored

31
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,900
worse worse than

32
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,800
I expected the contamination

33
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,300
level and keeps Rising.

34
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,400
Damn it. We cannot ask these people to change their

35
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,700
diet. There's no chance of error. I

36
00:02:58,700 --> 00:02:59,800
check it again.

37
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,400
Another month here isn't going to change our findings

38
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,500
already. These people have absorbed over a

39
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,400
hundred times a safe amount of

40
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,600
radioactive contamination the main

41
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,800
deities of the sea, who would you

42
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,600
accept a small

43
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,800
world, isn't it? Well, we

44
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,900
might as well tell Carlos will pack up and

45
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,700
go back to Vallejo in the morning.

46
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,100
I'll prepare a full report for the government

47
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,900
may not want to leave just yet Rick you got

48
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,900
there moored at sample of water. You want it for

49
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,700
the mouth of the river and

50
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,800
A lot more what would you say if I said I

51
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,900
had the devil in that canister, but I would

52
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,700
say that more time has got

53
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,800
a cook. I sense of humor those

54
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,900
local villagers aren't the only fisherman around here.

55
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,000
See what I got.

56
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:01,500
wait

57
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,800
If you've got a brain the size

58
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,700
now they say the octopus is supposed to be the most

59
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,500
intelligent species in the ocean

60
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,800
never seen anything like that before never.

61
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:17,700
It must be a hybrid of some sort and even a

62
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:18,300
mutation.

63
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,900
Let's go back to where you found. It said you with my ladies

64
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,200
bar. So she acted Myrick.

65
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,600
Neville can't weigh more than a few hours at Xerox of

66
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,600
kamla heavyweight. Let's not

67
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,100
overdramatize.

68
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,900
Let's concentrate on finding more where this came

69
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:39,300
from

70
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,200
How about a little fella you got any brothers or sisters?

71
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,700
Let it go once to get

72
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:57,200
somewhere.

73
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,500
It seems like it's waiting for a

74
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,400
signal.

75
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,200
You better get it back in there.

76
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,800
First thing in the morning. I'm going to take this into the research center in

77
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,600
Vallejo and show it to dr. Willy

78
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,800
navel if I went her old life. I've

79
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,900
got to I need some civilization

80
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,800
for a change. We'll keep an eye on the

81
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,900
shop. Well, let's bring back some

82
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,600
tobacco and matches lots of

83
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,700
matches, but we shouldn't be gone more than a day or two.

84
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,800
Hey the most joy joy.

85
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,500
We will call you number two

86
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,900
numero dos to distinguish you

87
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,300
from mr. Stein's

88
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,100
discovery.

89
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,300
Or this is seniorita.

90
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,900
Rick Campbell John, I'm sorry about the

91
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,700
short notice. That's all

92
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,900
right, what brings you

93
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,900
in business or pleasure?

94
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,600
You're the business Susanna's off to the beauty

95
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,600
parlor the

96
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,900
Practical female. She can prove

97
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,600
it. You know, we got engaged.

98
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,500
Okay say that I'm surprised

99
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,500
but you said there was something special we brought you back.

100
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,500
David

101
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,000
dead

102
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,500
you had a chance to study its habits

103
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,799
preliminary examination short of dissection,

104
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:37,700
but we did concur Rollin and

105
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,600
Stein and I that he was a fine

106
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,299
a mutation of sorts that have all the

107
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:44,300
characteristics of a human cell.

108
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,700
I don't agree that nowadays. We can believe all the study

109
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,900
Theory begins in the time that

110
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,400
man first crawled out of the sea

111
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,500
Frankie brick. I don't see any relevance

112
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,600
between this and your current field

113
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,900
Mission, but all the data we've gathered

114
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,500
so far John relates to see

115
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,100
life.

116
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:02,800
I look.

117
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,600
The past two years

118
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,700
Your Role water tests in various parts of the

119
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,700
world have definitely proved

120
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:11,300
something.

121
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,500
But this odd Little Squid

122
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,300
first establish any relation between its

123
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,800
mutation and polluted

124
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,300
water.

125
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,900
We agreed Britain Canyons of your grant for more

126
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,400
proof of damage to human

127
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,900
arteries increased blood pressure link

128
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,100
to some contamination.

129
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,700
But one of our available funds are no earmarks

130
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,800
aboard for the rick Gary the

131
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,700
ecological study.

132
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,600
Alive or dead this specimen

133
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,900
begs for further study. Don't

134
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,100
you agree? Dr. James?

135
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,400
I think the possibilities are endless

136
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,800
something like this could lead us to the

137
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,700
basic structure of life itself

138
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,600
even reveal some shift in The evolutionary

139
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,800
process that can create something

140
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,400
half man half sea creature

141
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,700
John won't you at

142
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,900
least give it consideration?

143
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,400
I'm sorry Ricardo.

144
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,100
I got on money somewhere else

145
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,800
Rick. I believe me. I

146
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,800
hope you succeed.

147
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,800
Howdy doc, you gotta be steep

148
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,500
Dodge boy. Have I heard about you?

149
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,600
Susan Fest Wranglers stuntman animal

150
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,400
trainer runs.

151
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
She didn't leave too much out about you. Either back.

152
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,700
That'll be the best sales pitch. I ever got on the telephone

153
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,800
if you got to be Einstein and that's all fell

154
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,900
all rolled up into one. Well, she filled me in a bit

155
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,800
about Johnny Caruso to well

156
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,700
Caruso needs to know is that there may be a

157
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,600
circus attraction in it. What circus

158
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,600
I look JC is no scientist.

159
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,700
I mean, he's won everything from this animal farm to us

160
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,500
traveling Sideshow out of Coney

161
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,200
Island anytime. He

162
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,100
bankrolled.

163
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,700
He wants to know what's in it for him satisfaction of

164
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,400
knowing you supporting a worthwhile

165
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,600
scientific field trip. She don't

166
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,600
Savvy that that man

167
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,300
fish talking spark him

168
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,100
man fish to

169
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,900
above the next Carney man. He wants to know what

170
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,000
the attraction is.

171
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,800
That's about the size of it.

172
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,900
Just the other night on TV. I show one of them will

173
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,900
clicks about an eighth time in

174
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,700
the Empire State Building the

175
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,700
whole damn Army chase me. He

176
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,700
kept swatting them airplanes buzzing

177
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,900
around it. Like they were blue-tailed flies

178
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,500
taking Jessie.

179
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,800
All right. Dogs is the James boys.

180
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,900
How about a Johnny TV?

181
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,200
Tell me.

182
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,300
Thank you partner.

183
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,400
Sunday's keeps right up with us.

184
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,800
How much worth it. I guess it all the way out

185
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,700
here. I've been over better roads

186
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,500
chasing wild kangaroos in Austin

187
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,100
country.

188
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,300
Look

189
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,800
Henry takes

190
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,100

191
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,000
for an excuse.

192
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,500
We're almost there - will announce ourselves

193
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,200
place looks deserted. I don't

194
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,000
understand.

195
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,000
Hello.

196
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:34,400
Hello.

mart mart

201
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,300
I've got lots of matches for you.

202
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,700
Maybe they went to an air-cooled movie.

203
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,500
some animal Maybe

204
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,400
Good, we've been human.

205
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,900
Had to be more than one to do this.

206
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,800
Is he the only one you left here?

207
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,300
Almost Stein and Carlos.

208
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,500
Where's Susan?

209
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:05,800
What are you doing?

210
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,800
Never even saw what happened. Rick had gone

211
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,600
into town to check on some of our control

212
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,600
cases Carlos took off to visit his

213
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,700
parents. We'd found a second squared

214
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,200
Monroe Was preparing it for

215
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,900
dissection Senor. I am every

216
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,700
K. I'll be happy if the

217
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:36,500
village of Tessa

218
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,300
It's not funny be two three miles.

219
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,400
We could bury your Amigo in our church our

220
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,800
senior if you win. Thank you.

221
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,900
We've already taken care of it. May

222
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,800
I see where it happened? Yes, of

223
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,300
course.

224
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,800
They tell me there's some sort of superstition about half

225
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,800
man half sea serpent with many

226
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,800
arms, but no one yet has

227
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,800
seen its annual

228
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,800
for my grandmother. I have heard about these

229
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,700
strange creatures.

230
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,400
He is now called me of winner.

231
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,700
The boy he draws were mixed things of wouldn't

232
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,400
play to sell them in the market

233
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,900
place under tonight. I sound like

234
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,300
the moon. My grandmother says,

235
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,600
where did you grandmother? Say the strange creature might be found.

236
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,600
I could lead you there Amigo saying

237
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,900
your according to his grandmother is

238
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,600
Pottery was taken by such a

239
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,500
creature. This happened

240
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,400
long.

241
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:13,099
His grandmother was a woman with a

242
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:15,500
big imagination.

243
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,800
It is fellow no never we met I just

244
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,900
started. He says he won't go

245
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:26,900
as for myself. I agree with him. If I were used in you ever

246
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,900
forget about I will

247
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,700
show you the place of which my

248
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,700
grandmother told me the authority

249
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,300
from the top of the hill. You can see what it is.

250
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:37,600
Well, Rick.

251
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,900
And on the way, it better be

252
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,800
Wicked first. I don't think it's

253
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,600
impossible mind. If we borrow these

254
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,300
scandals carry the water.

255
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,700
Okay? No be a

256
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,500
spoiler. This is like an Arab Village.

257
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,900
Beyond is in order Lake

258
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,800
beyond that still another all connected

259
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,300
like

260
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,700
Hannah chain, what is flow

261
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,900
from one to the other down from the scene?

262
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,800
But it is here. My grandmother's

263
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,500
did they leave?

264
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,700
Well, let's break happened follow those

265
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:29,400
beads.

266
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,200
tired, baby

267
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,800
It is better we go on before I

268
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,600
kissed our

269
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,000
IQ

270
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,000
in focus.

271
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:24,900
I'm not.

272
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:03,600
wisdom really offend you

273
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,300
music hath charms

274
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,300
to soothe the Savage breast

275
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,500
Let's hope those demons were after are aware of it.

276
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,800
The place like this would be going to think of God and creation.

277
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,900
The question is have we improved any

278
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:14,800
since creation

279
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,000
sure

280
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,700
to make mistakes. We also

281
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,800
make progress some good

282
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,700
some bad. It's all part of man's

283
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,400
Journey young people

284
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,900
underneath all that hair and you vote.

285
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,700
They know what it's about. They don't were doing

286
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,600
earth water.

287
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,800
Everything that grows. How do you

288
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,700
fit in Pickering?

289
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,600
I don't Savvy all that talk about us poisoning the

290
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,700
Earth. Well, the kids are my biology class must have

291
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,900
learned something. They're busy recycling everything

292
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,700
from Coke bottles plastic

293
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,500
containers. When you bring them the

294
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,700
arguments Professor me.

295
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,900
I'm going to bring him a half man half

296
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,900
sea serpent see who

297
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,000
they cheer harder for.

298
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,400
The water in this Lake test about the same for

299
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,900
radioactivity as we found in the village what

300
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,900
happens you drink enough of it turn

301
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:09,900
into a mutant.

302
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,600
Well, you remember the baby's born explainers

303
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,700
or without eyes or mouth after Hiroshima

304
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,800
had was Japan, you know Village it was

305
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,300
like that.

306
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,800
Air and water are everywhere you load them with

307
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,800
such poison. You are likely to

308
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,800
have deformity like the little

309
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,500
squid was sold with the eye.

310
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,500
You're going to tell me that killed your

311
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,700
Amigo mutation can be a hundred

312
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,800
times larger than normal. You'll find me

313
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,200
that giant squid doc.

314
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,700
We'll all get rich right Stevie

315
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:39,200
boy.

316
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,700
We're about ready to move on. We'll follow the shoreline

317
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,800
longest Chain of Lakes. He the way David of

318
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,100
Drury.

319
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:30,900
Will that be the beetle?

320
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,800
You have talent of you. Could I see you?

321
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,000
I know.

322
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,900
Someday, maybe I take lessons in

323
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,200
your squares in your more

324
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,900
Maya Square. Only teacher had a mug somebody,

325
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:54,800
okay?

326
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,300
Only teach you how to be like all the others.

327
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,100
Okay.

328
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,800
Got voting on am looking for anymore me and

329
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,800
Stevie. No. All right. Yeah, I

330
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,600
bet scientist the county

331
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,600
operator and one Expedition come one come

332
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,000
all.

333
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,600
You really expect to find anything in that drop of

334
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,800
bilge. Don't bother the scientist.

335
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,800
Your turn will come when we find it Cowboy whatever we're looking

336
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,100
for.

337
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,900
And then you can saddle break up.

338
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,600
like having watched

339
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,000
seen you like this before

340
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,800
it's as though you were listening to something.

341
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,800
What is it you do here?

342
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,400
whispering

343
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,200
Fine,

344
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,900
and I want

345
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,600
to run yet. I can't.

346
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,200
Don't you ever sleep?

347
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,300
What's biting you lately?

348
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:29,700
I don't know.

349
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:36,500
I got a hunch. We're coming up empty this

350
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,000
trip.

351
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,400
as my grandmother said it would be

352
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,900
in place of meeting. I saw

353
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,900
many of them here calling to one another.

354
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:12,600
It's gone.

355
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:21,800
First thing in the morning

356
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,500
so that camp around here.

357
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,100
Bring up the equipment.

358
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,700
The same thing are equal to each other.

359
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,900
What are you talking about? We have the

360
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,600
little creature. We could have

361
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,900
dissected them more like an

362
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,900
autopsy with those eyes looking up at

363
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:04,100
you.

364
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:09,800
Octopod species jellyfish

365
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,700
or kin to the mutants and were born in Hiroshima. That's a

366
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,400
mighty sentimental notion for a

367
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,900
scientist knows what Atomic radiation

368
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,200
is capable of creating.

369
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,000
Or distorting

370
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,800
you come I find more them

371
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,400
keep an eye on will be back soon.

372
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,000
Woman's Place is in the kitchen.

373
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:42,700
Hey.

374
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,500
I think I better keep an eye on her.

375
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,100
Johnny

376
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,699
And you never saw it.

377
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,500
I couldn't turn around. I tried to

378
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,699
but it held me like a nest of snakes

379
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,199
Carlos got a good look at it.

380
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,900
Take some of this Johnny.

381
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,900
Rick the specimen canister we left on

382
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:45,100
the table is gone.

383
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,699
The killer must have taken it.

384
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,500
I do not mean to frighten you seen your

385
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,900
toes always is dead. I am

386
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,900
sorry for Carlos. It is a like the

387
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:30,800
man who has killed him and I

388
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,500
believe there exists a sea

389
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,900
creature with the Arms of an octopus who walks on

390
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,200
the earth like a man

391
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,600
because I have seen him.

392
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:49,600
Natural habitat

393
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,800
long as it keeps out of mind. If you didn't have

394
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:58,600
your wrestling could like that to the ground

395
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:00,800
kind of equalize and guns.

396
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,700
The hell did it expect to find here anyway.

397
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,300
squeeze in the canister excited

398
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:15,400
You trying to tell me that?

399
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:18,700
There's some kind of communication

400
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,900
between what was in that Cannon and

401
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:21,600
that monster.

402
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,400
We found the canister What's Happening Here?

403
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,300
What part of a colorable

404
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:50,900
solve this time to get

405
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:52,900
the hell out while we can did you

406
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:54,900
hit him Johnny? It's going to take more than a couple

407
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:56,500
of shots to bring that thing down.

408
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,600
Really Fresh Mark the lead to the

409
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,800
lake. It will follow him Johnny's

410
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,300
right we make this last

411
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,800
It's counter we get out right on

412
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,700
his tail nailing this time. You

413
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:09,400
stay W in your

414
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,500
twenties. Somebody has to look after the scenery.

415
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,900
An extra gun under the driver seat, but I keep it handy.

416
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:20,400
Be careful.

417
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,200
cut the motor

418
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,200
that Direction

419
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:24,800
slow very slow

420
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:07,700
Cut the light.

421
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,400
How long would

422
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,800
it take it easy boy?

423
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:34,300
Try the motor again, Steve.

424
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,200
Johnny yeah.

425
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,900
If it's any consolation to you, it

426
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:05,600
wasn't the thing that was shooting.

427
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:27,600
Davida

428
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:30,800
David

429
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:47,000
Daddy, though.

430
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:51,800
David oh

431
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:56,600
David oh

432
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:08,700
I was a kid -

433
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,100
well he ought to know better.

434
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:42,200
The gun you can go on Rick.

435
00:46:59,100 --> 00:46:59,700
There it is.

436
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:03,100
No.

437
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:21,800
Don't let him get near the water see

438
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,800
his face. He doesn't like that light keep

439
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:33,900
pressing it Steve. I've got an idea.

440
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:01,800
You are beautiful sight to be holding me, though.

441
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:05,400
Remind me to tell you the story of David and

442
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:06,100
Goliath.

443
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:32,900
You make it back. I don't know

444
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:35,700
they have been out of the water too long as you're

445
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:37,600
watching. How do you control

446
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:39,500
is pumped full of tranquilizers?

447
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,800
And if worse comes to worst, we've always got these iced tea.

448
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:44,100
Okay, we get out now.

449
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:46,800
Okay, why not?

450
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:49,700
It's my bankroll and I say we go

451
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:51,700
back we must do some studies in its

452
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:52,900
natural habitat.

453
00:51:58,700 --> 00:51:59,900
Well don't count on me.

454
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:07,800
Never caught you haven't had any sleep

455
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,800
all night for that was me and the

456
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,700
kids take turns looking after our friend

457
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:14,700
here. All right.

458
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:27,100
Sleep at the post.

459
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:29,500
I'll be shot at Sunrise.

460
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,800
I must say she was out of your courage in the face of the

461
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:36,100
enemy inspiring.

462
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:40,800
I never thought of him.

463
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:46,400
the Beast

464
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:51,500
The old fairy tale about the lonely Beach

465
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:56,000
wanted was to be loved

466
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:57,600
the long.

467
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:02,300
Isn't that what we all

468
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:03,000
what?

469
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,200
Smells good after the rain

470
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:16,300
sounds of the Unseen World.

471
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:18,000
I wonder about the

472
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,100
language.

473
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:21,600
so lonely, so

474
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:24,500
maybe what sounds like

475
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,900
pain to us just the opposite to

476
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:29,200
them.

477
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:39,800
Up. There's the infant Eternal.

478
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:41,800
We Mortals feel we can

479
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:43,900
and must explain but we don't try

480
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:45,300
to explain other things like

481
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:52,300
attention so I get to my gun.

482
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:11,900
There was no warning all of a sudden he was Poppin

483
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:13,800
bellowing you wouldn't believe that unless you've

484
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:15,800
been here. He actually

485
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:17,900
got to it. We could have gone into

486
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:19,600
the brush or the lake.

487
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:22,600
Not with all those

488
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:24,200
Molotov cocktails to

489
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:25,000
protectors.

490
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:29,600
You got your matches wet boy. The rain

491
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:31,200
revived him. I couldn't help it.

492
00:56:32,300 --> 00:56:34,400
Now maybe you'll agree The Safaris over.

493
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:37,900
Let's make tracks doc. We can't give

494
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:39,900
up so close to a significant fine.

495
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:42,300
plea

496
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:49,900
The way I see it JC.

497
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:52,800
just in our decision to make

498
00:56:57,800 --> 00:56:58,400
okay.

499
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:11,900
You read the place it last place. You would go and

500
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:13,700
hides in your toilet with

501
00:57:13,700 --> 00:57:15,100
electrodes narrow

502
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:17,100
on its way from the scene.

503
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:22,400
Right cap soon as it's light.

504
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:05,800
You had us some horses. We might get around it.

505
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,900
Well, whatever put it there doesn't want to

506
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:09,400
saute.

507
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:18,900
Roman feeding it toolbox if we can pull

508
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:19,500
this behind.

509
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:00,000
start

510
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:07,800
Let it out.

511
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:31,300
Right again,

512
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:40,000
what back this thing out of here

513
01:00:41,700 --> 01:00:42,800
quickly. I'll be outside of

514
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:50,300
the veto.

515
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:52,100
Let me

516
01:00:52,100 --> 01:00:56,000
know.

517
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:56,900
Where are you.

518
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:19,600
David are you all right?

519
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:21,900
He I'd follow him here. I like

520
01:01:21,900 --> 01:01:23,700
tomorrow. We're going back

521
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:27,600
what I see him. It's no fair.

522
01:01:28,300 --> 01:01:30,800
You come so far for NADA finished.

523
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:34,600
Then I go.

524
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:42,700
Democratic Expedition doctor all those in favor

525
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:44,100
discontinuing say I

526
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:50,100
we go

527
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:15,700
It's something we having that.

528
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:45,500
Fresh Tracks in that direction

529
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:02,800
he's been here. I'm

530
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:04,500
beginning to wonder if we're following

531
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:06,600
him or he's following

532
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:07,100
us.

533
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:48,400
dead end

534
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:52,200
Let's get the hell out of here.

535
01:06:54,700 --> 01:06:55,700
Hey, Jenny.

536
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:58,900
Yeah, don't give up so

537
01:06:58,900 --> 01:07:00,600
soon. I remember

538
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:02,500
movie one I've ever

539
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:04,300
submarine Pratt.

540
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:07,100
on the bottom of the ocean

541
01:07:08,300 --> 01:07:09,400
the idea was

542
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:11,900
to save oxygen

543
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:15,300
not getting too excited.

544
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:18,600
He's right Johnny. You're

545
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:20,400
excited to just going to use more air.

546
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:24,800
No, they want think different.

547
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,200
comes quitting time

548
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:31,600
Guys in the fake submarine go home.

549
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,399
Well that's coming. You're not going

550
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:25,600
to see where it leaves water and

551
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:27,100
drowning for Lucky,

552
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:29,600
but there's barely room for you

553
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:30,100
Rick.

554
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:34,899
You'd be surprised what the body can compensate the place of

555
01:08:34,899 --> 01:08:36,600
survival? I am smart

556
01:08:36,899 --> 01:08:37,399
I go.

557
01:08:39,399 --> 01:08:41,600
David oh, all right.

558
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,700
That's 5,000 you owe me Steve. It

559
01:10:10,700 --> 01:10:12,800
says they didn't even like to quit while

560
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:13,600
I'm ahead.

561
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:32,900
Jesus

562
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:36,300
another one of those movies you saw

563
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:54,500
We'ii come out on the lake

564
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:56,900
